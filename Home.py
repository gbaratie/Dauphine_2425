Welcome to this application development course at Dauphine.
The goal of this project is to enable each group to develop their own application using a series of modern and powerful technologies.

## Technologies Used
For this project, you will work with the following technologies:

1. **Streamlit**: To create interactive and user-friendly web interfaces. Streamlit simplifies the process of building custom web applications with Python.

2. **Langchain**: A framework for developing applications using advanced language models. Langchain allows chaining calls to different language models to create complex applications.

3. **Cohere**: A natural language processing (NLP) model that offers powerful capabilities for text analysis, text generation, and other NLP tasks.

4. **WatsonX**: IBM's AI platform that provides advanced tools for data analysis, machine learning, and creating custom AI solutions.

5. **FastAPI**: A modern and fast web framework for building APIs with Python. It is ideal for creating performant and scalable backend services.

## Project Objectives
Each group is expected to create a functional application using the technologies mentioned above. The application should address a specific need and be accessible via a web interface.

## Project Structure
1. **Phase 1: Design** - Define the problem you want to solve with your application and design a solution using the mentioned technologies.

2. **Phase 2: Development** - Develop the application using Streamlit for the interface, Langchain and Cohere for NLP processing, WatsonX for AI functionalities, and FastAPI for the backend.

3. **Phase 3: Deployment** - Deploy your application on a platform of your choice, ensuring it is accessible and functional.

## Resources and Support
We will provide tutorials and documentation to help you familiarize yourself with these technologies. Technical support will also be available to answer your questions throughout the project.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your application will be evaluated based on:
- The relevance and originality of the proposed solution.
- Effective integration of the various technologies.
- The quality of the user interface.
- The performance and reliability of the application.

Good luck to everyone, and may the best project win!
